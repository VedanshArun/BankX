## üìù About the App

**‚ÄúMoody‚Äù** is a one-stop app to track your daily mood and monitor your sleep. By collecting information about your mood every day, the app gives you statistics about your mood changes, when you have felt happy, or when you have felt sad. It also gives information about how long you have been sleeping, and gives suggestions to cheer you up and help you fall asleep.

## Features 

### Mood Tracking & User Profile 

The app allows you to set your current mood as one of the 5 available options (‚ÄòHappy‚Äô , ‚ÄòSad‚Äô, ‚ÄòSick‚Äô, ‚ÄòProductive‚Äô, ‚ÄòAngry‚Äô) at any point during your day. You can also enter along, the reasons which have resulted in the particular mood you are in, which can be done by describing your day in the app or any particular incident that might have occured. 
Each application should give a personal experience to the user. User profile with all the details helps to personalize the app. Add your preferences, set time for your activity, and much more with the user profile.

### Sleep Monitor & Reminders

The sleep tracker analysis feature can help those working on their sleeping habits. It is designed for manual information or connected with a sleep examining the device, these features allow users with perspicacity about their sleep method and help them manage stability and potency throughout the day.
Some people have to take medicine at particular times throughout the day. A set of reminders with alerts can give the notifications by helping them to take medicines at the correct time.

### Feed, Journals & Data Sharing

Dealing with something is more comfortable when others around you are also dealing with it. Include a community feature into your application, offer text or video chats, let people share development and set goals, and so on.
Journaling helps people distribute their thoughts and understand what‚Äôs going on inside. As everyone is not comfortable physically writing down their thoughts and feelings, a journaling feature in your app could be a transferable and secure solution.
A mental health mobile app can enable users to share their moods with family and friends or on social media or with care providers. It can also enable users to export data or send it by email and other formats.

### Relaxation Techniques & Soothing Music

Carefulness is a great way to change everyday life. Breathing techniques, guided and unguided meditation, prayers, and positive confirmation are just a few of the features you might include in the app.
Calm Music helps put your mind at ease and help you in making falling asleep easier.
